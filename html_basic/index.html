    <h1>Welcome to My First ALX Webpage</h1>
    
    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>This webpage is my first project for the ALX Software Engineering program. It demonstrates my understanding of basic HTML structure and elements. Through this exercise, I'm learning how to create valid, semantic HTML that follows web standards and best practices.</p>
    
    <p>The project requires creating a webpage with specific elements including headings of different levels, multiple paragraphs, and a clickable image. This helps build a foundation in web development that I'll use throughout my career as a software engineer.</p>
    
    <h3>Learning HTML Basics</h3>
    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the backbone of the web. Every website you visit is built with HTML. It provides the structure and content of web pages. Learning HTML is the first step in becoming a web developer, and it's essential for creating accessible, well-structured websites.</p>
    
    <h2>The Importance of Semantic HTML</h2>
    <p>Semantic HTML means using HTML elements according to their intended purpose. For example, using &lt;h1&gt; for main headings, &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs, and &lt;img&gt; for images. Semantic HTML improves accessibility for screen readers, helps with SEO, and makes code easier to read and maintain.</p>
    
    <h3>Web Development Journey</h3>
    <p>My journey in web development starts with HTML, but it will continue with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. The ALX program provides a comprehensive curriculum that covers both front-end and back-end technologies, preparing me to become a full-stack developer.</p>
    
    <p>Creating this webpage is just the beginning. As I progress through the program, I'll build more complex projects, learn about responsive design, databases, APIs, and deployment. Each project builds upon the previous one, creating a strong foundation in software engineering.</p>

    <h2>Future Goals</h2>
    <p>Through the ALX Software Engineering program, I aim to develop the skills needed to build impactful applications. I want to create solutions that address real-world problems, contribute to open-source projects, and eventually work as a professional software engineer on meaningful projects that make a difference.</p>
